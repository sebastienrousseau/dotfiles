This is a collection of aliases for the GNU Coreutils package, which is
a set of standard Unix utilities often included in Linux distributions.
These aliases allow for easier use of these utilities by providing
shorthand commands that replace the full utility name with a shorter
alias.

The aliases in this collection cover a wide range of utilities, from
basic file manipulation commands like "cp" and "rm" to more advanced
text processing commands like "awk" and "sed". There are also aliases
for various checksum and hash utilities like "md5sum" and "sha256sum".
