This code provides a set of command aliases to make common tasks and
commands more convenient and faster to execute. These aliases range from
general purpose to system monitoring and file system navigation.

Some of the most useful aliases include:

- `c`: shortcut for the `clear` command to clear the terminal screen.
- `p`: shortcut for the `pwd` command to display the current working
  directory.
- `h`: lists all recently used commands.
- `path`: displays the `$PATH` variable on new lines.
- `quit`: shortcut for the `exit` command to exit the shell.
- `halt`, `poweroff`, `reboot`: system shutdown and reboot commands.
- `srv`: starts a simple HTTP server.
- `top`: allows the user to interactively monitor the system's vital
  resources or server's processes in real-time.
- `qfind`: quickly search for files.
- `clc`: clear the terminal screen and print the contents of the current
  directory.
