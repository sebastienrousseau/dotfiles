This code provides command aliases for editing files on a Unix-based
system using various text editors.

The following editors are supported:

- nano (GNU nano)
- vim (Vim)
- vi (Vi)
- code (Visual Studio Code)
- gedit (gedit)
- notepad++ (Notepad++)

The aliases are designed to make it easy for users to quickly open and
edit files with their preferred text editor. The aliases are:

- `e`: Edit a file
- `edit`: Edit a file
- `editor`: Edit a file
- `mate`: Edit a file
- `n`: Edit a file
- `v`: Edit a file

The code checks if any of the supported editors are installed on the
system and sets the corresponding alias to open the file in the
available editor.

This makes it easy for users to switch between editors or use their
preferred editor without having to remember the specific command for
each editor.

Enjoy the convenience of quickly editing files with these command
aliases!
