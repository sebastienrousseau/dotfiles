This code provides a set of command aliases for the `fd` utility that is
an alternative to the `find` command on Unix-based systems.

`fd` is a simple, fast, and user-friendly tool that can be used to
search for files and directories in a given path. These aliases make it
easier to use `fd` by providing simple and memorable commands for common
use cases.

Here are some of the available aliases:

- `fd` is the default alias for `fd --color always` that lists all files
  with colorized output.
- `fda` lists all files with absolute paths.
- `fdc` lists all files with case-insensitive search.
- `fdd` lists all files with details.
- `fde` lists all files with a specified extension.
- `fdf` lists all files while following symbolic links.
- `fdh` shows help for `fd`.
- `fdh` lists all files, including hidden files.
- `fdn` lists all files that match a specified glob.
- `fdo` lists all files with owner information.
- `fds` lists all files with size.
- `fdu` lists all files with exclusion rules.
- `fdv` shows the version of `fd`.
- `fdx` executes a command for each search result.
