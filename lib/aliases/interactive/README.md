- `del` Remove a file or directory.
- `ln` Create a symbolic link.
- `mv` Move files interactively (ask before overwrite) and verbose.
- `rm` Prompts for every file before removing.
- `zap` Remove files interactively (ask before overwrite).

### Trash manipulation alias

- `bin` Remove all files in the trash.

### Other interactive aliases

- `chmod` Change permissions of a file or directory.
- `chown` Change the owner and group of a file or directory.
- `diff` Compare two files and show the differences.
- `grep` Search for a pattern in a file or output.
- `mkdir` Create a new directory and display a message on success.
- `touch` Create a new file and display a message on success.
