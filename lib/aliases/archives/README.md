This code provides a set of command aliases to help users compress and extract files and directories in various formats on a Unix-based system.

The following compression formats are supported:

- 7z
- bzip2
- gzip
- jar
- lz4
- lzma
- lzo
- pigz
- tar
- xz
- zstd
- zip

These aliases enable users to compress or extract files and directories quickly by using simple commands.

For example:

- `c7z` can be used to compress a whole directory (including subdirectories) to a 7z file.
- `e7z` can be used to extract a whole directory (including subdirectories) from a 7z file.

Similarly, there are aliases for compressing and extracting files and directories in all supported formats.

The aliases are designed to be easy to remember and use, and they should make the compression and extraction process much simpler for users.

Please note that some of the compression formats may require additional software to be installed on your system.

Enjoy the convenience of quickly compressing and extracting files and directories with these command aliases!
