This code provides a set of command aliases to help users compress and
extract files and directories in various formats on a Unix-based system.

The following compression formats are supported:

- 7z
- bzip2
- gzip
- jar
- lz4
- lzma
- lzo
- pigz
- tar
- xz
- zstd
- zip

These aliases enable users to compress or extract files and directories
quickly by using simple commands.

For example:

- `c7z` can be used to compress a whole directory (including
  subdirectories) to a 7z file.
- `e7z` can be used to extract a whole directory (including
  subdirectories) from a 7z file.

Similarly, there are aliases for compressing and extracting files and
directories in all supported formats.

The aliases are designed to be easy to remember and use, and they should
make the compression and extraction process much simpler for users.

Please note that some of the compression formats may require additional
software to be installed on your system.

Enjoy the convenience of quickly compressing and extracting files and
directories with these command aliases!
