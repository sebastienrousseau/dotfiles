# ğŸ…³ğŸ…¾ğŸ†ƒğŸ…µğŸ…¸ğŸ…»ğŸ…´ğŸ†‚ - Cross-Platform Sentencecase Utility (sentencecase)
# Made with â™¥ by Sebastien Rousseau
# License: MIT
#
# Description:
#   sentencecase converts file or directory names to sentence case. It capitalizes
#   the first character of the first word, while the rest of the characters are
#   lowercased. This is different from title case, as only the very first letter
#   is capitalized.
#
# Usage:
#   sentencecase <file_or_directory> [<file_or_directory> ...]
#
# Arguments:
#   <file_or_directory>     One or more file or directory paths to rename
#                           to sentence case.
#
# Notes:
#   - Already sentence case files are skipped.
#   - Non-existent paths will produce an error message.
#   - Complex scenarios (multiple words, punctuation) are handled by simply
#     making all letters lowercase except the first character.
