# GNU coreutils aliases

The `gnucoreutls-aliases.sh` file creates helpful shortcut aliases for many commonly used [GNU coreutils][coreutils] commands. The GNU Core Utilities are
the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating
system.

These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating
system.
