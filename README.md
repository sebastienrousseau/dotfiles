## Usage üìñ

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download Dotfiles

You can download the latest version (v0.2.465) with the following options:

- [**Manual download**][releases-url] - **The easiest way to install Dotfiles.**
- [**Install with PnPM**][package-url]
  `pnpm i @sebastienrousseau/dotfiles`.
- [**Install with Npm**][package-url]
  `npm install @sebastienrousseau/dotfiles`.
- [**Install with Yarn**][package-url]
  `yarn add @sebastienrousseau/dotfiles`.
- **Clone the main repository** to get all source files including build scripts:
  `git clone https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/dotfiles.git`. This will clone
  the latest version of the Dotfiles repository.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Back Up Your Existing Data

Before installing Dotfiles, we strongly recommend that you back up your existing
data. The Dotfiles installer will try to automatically backup any previous
installation of known dotfiles into a backup directory
`$HOME/dotfiles_backup`.

The backup files are the following:

```bash
.alias
.bash_aliases
.bash_profile
.bash_prompt
.bashrc
.curlrc
.dir_colors
.exports
.functions
.gitattributes
.gitconfig
.gitignore
.gitmessage
.inputrc
.npmrc
.path
.profile
.tmux.conf
.vimrc
.wgetrc
.yarnrc
.zshenv
.zshrc
cacert.pem
```

It is always a good idea to backup as there might be situations in which you
could be required to restore your previous installation.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Try it out and let us know what you think

To install the latest version of the dotfiles, run the following command:

#### Using make (easiest)

The easiest way to install Dotfiles is to use the `make` command. This will
install the latest version of the dotfiles and will automatically backup
any existing dotfiles you may have into a backup directory
`$HOME/dotfiles_backup`.

The installer will check if you have PnPM installed to switch to the PnPM
installation method. If not, it will fallback to equivalent shell scripts.

Switch to the `dist` directory and run:

```bash
make build
```

You can also just check the installer options available, by simply running:

```bash
make help
```

#### Using Node.js (advanced)

If you want to install Dotfiles using Node.js, you can run the following
command in the `dist` directory located in your
`node_modules/@sebastienrousseau/dotfiles/dist` directory:

```bash
node .
```

This will install the latest version of the dotfiles and will automatically
backup any existing dotfiles you may have into a backup directory
`$HOME/dotfiles_backup`.

#### Using PnPM (highly recommended if you have PnPM installed)

PnPM is a key dependency of the dotfiles package. It will help you install the
dotfiles rapidly and very efficiently.

Switch to the `dist` directory and run:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This will install the latest version of the dotfiles and will automatically
backup any existing dotfiles you may have into a backup directory
`$HOME/dotfiles_backup`.

### Post installation

Following the installation, you can verify that the dotfiles package is
installed in the following directory `$HOME/dotfiles_backup`.

Just quit your terminal and restart it. If the installation is successful, you
should be able to see a new interface of your terminal and be able to start
using the dotfiles aliases and other configurations.
